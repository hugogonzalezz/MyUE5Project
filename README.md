# Third-Person Horror Game - Unreal Engine 5

I built a third-person horror game in Unreal Engine 5 as a passion project. This was an exciting challenge that allowed me to experiment with game mechanics, level design, and the overall workflow of Unreal Engine. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with the engine's blueprint system, AI behavior trees, and environmental design to create an immersive horror experience.

I created this project to deepen my understanding of Unreal Engine 5 and how it differs from other game engines. Many engines have unique workflows and tools, and I wanted to explore the realm of third-person and 3D game development. This project was an opportunity to step beyond 2D or first-person experiences and gain insight into more advanced game development techniques.

I developed this game using Unreal Engine 5’s blueprint system and experimented with different features to bring the horror atmosphere to life. The process involved:

Level Design: Creating eerie environments using Unreal Engine’s landscape tools, lighting effects, and asset integration.
Gameplay Mechanics: Implementing character movement, interaction, and horror elements such as dynamic lighting, sound triggers, and AI-controlled enemies.
AI & Enemy Behavior: Using Unreal Engine’s behavior trees to design enemy AI that reacts to the player’s actions.
Optimization & Testing: Debugging performance issues, tweaking mechanics, and ensuring smooth gameplay.
This project provided me with valuable experience in Unreal Engine, game mechanics, and the complexities of creating a horror-themed game.
